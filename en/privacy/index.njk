      <li><strong>Responding to your request</strong> via the contact form (legal basis: pre-contractual steps and/or legitimate interest in handling enquiries).</li>
      <li><strong>Security and service maintenance</strong> (legal basis: legitimate interest in ensuring the site’s integrity and availability).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>Messages from the contact form are retained for the time needed to handle your request and, at most, 12 months unless a subsequent relationship justifies longer retention. Technical logs are kept for short periods in line with security practices.</p>

      <li><strong>Email provider</strong> (sending and receiving contact messages).</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Some technology providers may operate from outside the EEA. Where applicable, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>You may exercise your rights of access, rectification, erasure, objection, restriction and portability by emailing <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>. If you believe your rights have not been respected, you can lodge a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (<a href="https://www.aepd.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aepd.es</a>).</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This site and the contact form are not intended for children under 14. If we detect minors’ data without authorisation, we will delete it safely.</p>
